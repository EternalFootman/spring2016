Today we will:

* Make your first post to our github blog
* Go over some Github basics
* (hopefully) make your second post to our Github blog.  You'll have the weekend to finish if you need it.


For next class you will:

* Read about Variables
* Make some basic Python Programs
* Turn in your Python programs with a short reflective post (on Github) about the experience of coding and submitting them


Let's get going!

* A theme for programming: **type and read your code closely**
